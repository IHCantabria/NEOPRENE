# The NEOPRENE library

## Concept

The **NEOPRENE** library allows to work with Neyman-Scott models for rainfall emulations in an easy way. The library has two main functionalities:

1. **Model Calibration:** Taking daily or hourly time series, or their characteristics statistics, a set of optimal parameters are computed. These parameters allow to reproduce the main statistical properties of the time series, or at least, the provided statistics.

2. **Rainfall Generation:** Given a set of parameters, time series at the daily or hourly scale, or their characteristics statistics can be generated.

A mathematical description of the model is given in the [linked document](MathematicalDescription.md). The statistical properties of the model are shown in the [linked document](Statistical_properties.ipynb)

The following sections present the calibraton and validation hyperparameters, as well as some elements that should be considered when using the **NEOPRENE** library.

## Implementation

The library can be used for single-site application ([NSRP_test.ipynb](https://github.com/IHCantabria/NEOPRENE/blob/main/notebooks/NSRP_test.ipynb)) or for multi-site rainfall generation ([STNSRP_test.ipynb](https://github.com/IHCantabria/NEOPRENE/blob/main/notebooks/NSRP_test.ipynb)). The multi-site model (STNSRPM) requires some extra parameteres to fit the observed the spatial correlation. Thus, some of the paremeteres present here are used only for the space-time model:

1. Storm arrivals follow a **Poisson** process of parameter &lambda; expressed in storms per square kilometer and per day.
2. Each storm is characterized by a number of cells that follow a **Poisson** process of parameter &upsilon; expressed in storm cells per storm.
3. Each storm cell is characterized by three variables:
   1. The cell lag from the storm origin that follows an **Exponential** process of parameter &beta; measured in hours^-1.
   2. The cell duration that follows an **Exponential** process of parameter &epsilon; measured in hours^-1.
   3. The cell rainfall intensity that follow an **Exponential** process of parameter &chi; measured in hours per milimeter.
   4. The cell radius follows an **Exponential** process of par√°meter $phi; mersure in km^-1 (only for the STNSRPM).

## Calibration hyperparameters
The calibration parameters have to be filled in the yml file. The folder notebooks presents some examples [Input_Cal_PD.yml](https://github.com/IHCantabria/NEOPRENE/blob/main/notebooks/Input_Cal_PD.yml), [Input_Cal_PH.yml](https://github.com/IHCantabria/NEOPRENE/blob/main/notebooks/Input_Cal_PH.yml) and [Input_Cal_SPD.yml](https://github.com/IHCantabria/NEOPRENE/blob/main/notebooks/Input_Cal_SPD.yml). The calibration parameters are explained below. 

+ **Data:** Pandas ```DataFrame``` that contains the original time series of rainfall.

+ **Seasonality:**  Python ```list``` that configures the desired seasonality for the model. Calibration can be done in a monthly basis, by season or by year. In the calibration hyperparameters file the seasonality type is defined within the Seasonality_type field. This can be annual, seasonal, montly or user_defined. If the seasonality is user_defined it is necessary to enter in the Seasonality_user field the seasonality of the user's choice.
  + _annual_: The library assumes that a single set of parameters is able to capture the dynamics for the whole year.
  + _seasonal_: The library merges the different months into the prescribed groups, fitting a different set of parameters per group.
  + _monthly_: The library fits a different set of parameters for each month of the time series.
  + _user_defined_: The user can define a seasonality different from the previous groups.
  
+ **Seasonality_user:** if the seasonality is set to _user_defined, the desired seasonality must be defined with this parameter.
    ```python
    ['(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)','(7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)']
    ```
+ **temporal_resolution:** ```string``` specifying the temporal resolution of the time series provided to the calibration process.

    ```python
    temporal_resolution = 'h' # Hourly resolution
    temporal_resolution = 'd' # Daily resolution
    ```

+ **process**: ```string``` configuring the model type.

  ```python
  process = 'normal' # Only one type of storm is considered
  process = 'storms' # Convective and Frontal storms are considered
  ```

+ **statistics_name:** ```list``` of ```strings``` that contain the statistics that have to be considered during the fitting process. The statistics included are:

   ```python
   statistics = ['mean', # Rainfall average
                'var_h', # Variance
                'autocorr_l_h', # Autocorrelation
                'fih_h', # Probability of no rainfall
                'fiWW_h', # Transition probability from rainy period to rainy period
                'fiDD_h', # Transition probability from dry period to dry period
                'M3_h', # Skewness
                'crosscorr_h'] # Spatial cross-correlation (only for the STNSRPM)
   ```

   Statistics may refer to different lags (```l```) and aggregation levels (```h```), where the aggregation levels indicate the number of temporal resolutions over which the value is aggregated.

+ **weights:** ```list``` that contains the weights for computing the total error during the calibration process

  ```python
  weights = [100, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  ```

+ **number_iterations:** ```integer``` to define the maximum number of iterations of the calibration process

    ```python
    number_iterations = 20
    ```

+ **number_bees:** ```integer``` defining the number of particles to be used by the calibration algorithm. Calibration is carried out by means of a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.

  ```python
  number_bees = 10000
  ```
  
+ **number_initializations:**```integer``` defining the number of initializations to be performed during the calibration procedure.

   ```python
  number_initializations = 1
  ```

+ **time_between_storms:** ```list``` defining the range of inter-storm arrival times. The inter-storm arrival time is the inverse of the &lambda; parameter.

  ```python
  time_between_storms = [20, 1000] # hours
  ```

+ **number_storm_cells:** ```list``` defining the range of possible values for the number of storm cells per storm (&upsilon;)

  ```python
  number_storm_cells = [1, 100] # number of cells per storm
  ```

+ **cell_duration:** ```list``` defining the range of possible storm duration values. It is the inverse of the &epsilon; parameter.

  ```python
  cell_duration = [0.15, 5] # hours
  ```

+ **cell_intensity:** ```list``` defining the range of intensities of each storm cell. It is the inverse of the &chi; parameter.

  ```python
  cell_intensity = [0.5, 2000] # mm / hour 
  ```

+ **storm_cell_displacement:** ```list``` defining the range of acceptable lags between the storm origin and each storm cell. It is the inverse of the &beta; parameter.

  ```python
  storm_cell_displacement = [1.01, 50] # hours
  ```

  ```python
  coordinates: 'geographical' #geographical/UTM
  ```
  
+ **storm_radius:** ```True or False``` when the process is True, the storm radius is included. In that case it uses the following parameter **storm_radius_p**, otherwise it is not used.
  ```python
  storm_radius: False
  ```

+ **cell_radius:** ```list``` defiining the range of the cell radius (km).
  ```python
  cell_radius: [0.5, 10] # km
  ```
