# NEOPRENE: Neyman-Scott Process Rainfall Emulator

The **NEOPRENE** library implements a rectangular pulses model for rainfall emulation based on the Neyman-Scott process. The emulator may be used to generate synthetic rainfall time series that reproduce observed statistics at different temporal aggregations. It has been designed with rainfall dissaggregation and extreme rainfall analysis in mind.

The description of the Neyman-Scott Process -or Spatio-temporal Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulses Model- can be found in the [doc folder](https://github.com/IHCantabria/NEOPRENE/tree/main/doc).

A paper describing the library has been sent for review to _Environmental Modelling & Software_.

## Requirements

Scripts and (jupyter) notebooks are provided in [Python](https://www.python.org/) to ensure reproducibility and reusability of the results. The simplest way to match all these requirements is by using a dedicated [conda](https://docs.conda.io) environment, which can be easily installed by issuing:

```sh
conda create -n NEOPRENE pip jupyter
conda activate NEOPRENE
pip install NEOPRENE
```

## Examples of use

Examples of use of the `NEOPRENE` library are available in the form of [jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/IHCantabria/NEOPRENE/tree/main/notebooks). To run the examples follow the following steps:

1. Download the folder [notebooks](https://github.com/IHCantabria/NEOPRENE/tree/main/notebooks) from the github repository, or navigate to the folder should you have cloned the repo.
2. Open jupyter notebook of Jupyter Lab (type `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`  in the terminal)
3. Open one of the tests available in the [notebooks](https://github.com/IHCantabria/NEOPRENE/tree/main/notebooks) folder with jupyter notebook  (e.g. [NSRP_test.ipynb](https://github.com/IHCantabria/NEOPRENE/blob/main/notebooks/NSRP_test.ipynb))
